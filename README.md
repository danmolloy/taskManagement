# Task Management App
## Overview
This task management app has been created as a learning exercise in C# and ASP.NET. It provides a platform for users to manage their tasks efficiently and securely.

## Features
- **User Auth**: Utilises Entity Framework Core for Authentication and Authorization, allowing users to save their tasks securely.
- **Guest Functionality**: Leveraging client-side state, guest users can interact with the task methods functionality.
- **Filter and sort**: Users can sort lists by creation date or completion status, as well as choosing to hide or show completed tasks.
- **CRUD operations**: Full support for create, read, update and delete database operations on tasks.
